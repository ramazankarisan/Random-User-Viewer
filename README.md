# Random User Viewer

- In this project, when the page is loaded, it comes with 20 results as default. All results are populated in a table. On the Location column, anyone can make search by country names, and also when want to see the location on the map, can click the map button, so a modal will be opened with a map inside it. At the bottom we have a pagination container.

> With pagination, it is not perfect, I could not check every possible
> user's behaviour. But mainly it is functional, the others just a
> matter of time.

- Number of the results from **[API](https://randomuser.me/documentation)**  could be also changed through the input. Results to be shown per page could be changed through a select input.
